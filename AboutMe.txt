Hello! 

I’m Marilaine Calzado, a Gemini born in the '90s, and I am zealous to become a Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA). 

Someday, I hope to visit Italy and experience Eurovision in person.

I am mentally unhealthy with where I am right now in life, but I’m holding on. 

Recently, I rekindled my love for reading and snagged three books from the bookstore. The best part? I got a book originally priced at P1,395.00 for just P130.00! Can you believe it? 

Oh by the way, Turquoise is my favorite color, and Wednesday is my preferred day of the week. 
Thanks for getting to know me, stranger!
